This directory is for external dependendencies. As of now they are managed by git-subtree.

To import a new dependency with git subtree use a command like
git subtree add --prefix=vendor/luaposix https://github.com/luaposix/luaposix.git v36.1 --squash
v36.1 here is a tag

TBD: manage external dependencies with something like git-vendor.

P.S. git vendor github page is https://github.com/brettlangdon/git-vendor but as it sees to be
abandoned, maybe https://github.com/Tyrben/git-vendor should be used or even
create own fork to allow for several versions of the same repository to be vendored (we
need this for PAPI in lomonosov-2)
